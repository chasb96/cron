# Tasker

[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chasb96/tasker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chasb96/tasker)

Tool to delegate background tasks. Made to create and simplify scheduled commands and event-based commands/event listeners.

Tasker reads from a `JSON` file configured by the user. The `JSON` file is to contain any configuration details and the commands that Tasker is meant to run. Each command will have meta associated with it instructing when to run: this can either be at a specific time, interval, event, or date.

Tasker had some bare functionality, but to meet personal standards, is being rewritten and reimplimented. The standards can be found in Contributing.md. This tool is meant both to be something that actually runs and maintains itself, but also as a learning experience and learning platform, an area to flex and grow my capabilities as a developer.
